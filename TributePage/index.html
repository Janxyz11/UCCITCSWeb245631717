                My father has always been one of the strongest people in my life. Growing up, he was there for me in ways I didn't fully 
                understand working hard, providing for us, and making sure I had what I needed. He didn't give me everything I wanted, 
                but he gave me enough to learn what matters. He showed his love quietly through long days of work and sacrifices he never 
                talked about. Now that I'm older, I appreciate everything he has done for me, and I cherish every moment and effort he 
                gave just to make my life better.

                He has always loved basketball, and I think that passion reflects his attitude in life always aiming high, always pushing 
                forward. He worked here in Baguio while I was young, but when his job moved to Cavite, he had to make the difficult choice 
                to follow it for our sake. We don't get to see each other often anymore, and it's not easy, but he never stopped being a 
                father. His messages, calls, and constant care remind me that distance can't lessen real love. I'm proud of him, grateful 
                for him, and I hope one day I can give back even a part of what he has given me.
